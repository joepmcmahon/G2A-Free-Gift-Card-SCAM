G2A "FREE GIFT CARDS" SCAM!  BEWARE AZARIYMITKOV@GMAIL.COM

obfuscated-scams
You ever went on paste bin and suddenly, boom there it is! A giftcard or G2A scam staring right at you telling you to download a shady TAMPERMONKEY script so they can get the $$$ for themselves, by that I mean the "Time Glitch" scam..
Now I don't know whose lonely braincell thought it'd be awesome to trick people into thinking they can get free stuff from G2A with a "Time Glitch", which a script supposedly does... But what it really does is it replaces the BTC address you'd normally pay to G2A with their own little address, along with a custom QR code.

It consists of these 3 main tactics:
Promising free stuff by doing a time glitch
You installing their malicious script
Paying them to their bitcoin address. Some better, some worse these scripts are like a rubicks cube for a programmer, easy to solve and also rewarding; knowing the feeling that the scammer is getting his ass exposed..
TL;DR
NEVER and I say NEVER click on any links in pastebin if they promise anything free; and NEVER download any tampermonkey script that's not uploaded to a trusted source such as GreasyFork.
